Day 24 (Started on Aug 1)

1. Before today
I was very confused in my DSA preparation.



If I tried a question for even 10 minutes, I would lose hope.



I immediately checked YouTube or some resource for the solution.



I started doubting myself: “Maybe this is not for me… maybe I don’t know arrays properly.”



2. Past few days



I picked questions from Striver sheet.



I used to open the tutorial → watch the video → solve.



Solved similar questions too, but avoided twisted ones.



My focus was more on quantity of problems, not quality.



3. Today’s turning point



I watched this video:

If You Cannot Build Logic, You Cannot Solve LeetCode Problems | Techie Bytess

(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr6v0lI517A

)



I realized it’s not just me. Many people go through the same struggle.



That gave me relief and confidence.



4. New approach I will follow



Don’t blindly count daily questions or rush tutorials.



Try to solve each problem with full intensity, like doing a college project.



If I get stuck → check only hints (AI tools, LeetCode discuss).



If still stuck → identify the topic I’m weak in, study that, then retry.



If still failing → finally watch the video solution.



After solving → focus on optimizing my solution.



5. Result today



I worked on the Array Subset problem.



It took me 2 hours to solve the brute-force version.



But I felt really satisfied with the effort.



For the first time, I didn’t care about not updating my GFG streak (green box).



I’m happy because I built the logic myself instead of just copying.



🔥 Lesson: Slow progress is still progress. Today I felt like I truly learned something.
